# EFR32BG24_RRC_BT

> Note: The Bluetooth SoC-Empty example serves as a template for this standalone Bluetooth application.

## Overview

This project shows implementation of various peripheral drivers for EFR32BG24 Bluetooth SoC chip.

Hardware required:
- Main: Wireless Pro Kit with the BRD4316A Radio Board
- External: BGM240SA22VNA SoC

Software required:
- Gecko SDK Suite version - 4.3.0
- Simplicity Studio - SSv5
- VSCode with "Simplicity Studio for VS Code" extension (not mandatory)

## Driver releases
